### Step 1: Create a new project
<PackageManagers command="create" text="@sern/bot" />

sern has been created with the goal of making it easier to create Discord bots, so we've made it simple to get a boilerplate up and running with a single command.

### Step 2: Adding a token

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your bot token to the `DISCORD_TOKEN` field.  
If you're not familiar with how to get a bot token, you can follow the tutorial on [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).

Make sure to enable the "Server Members" and "Message Content" intents!

### Step 3: Invite the bot to your server

Again, we recommend using [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) for this step.

### Step 4: Run the bot!

A development command inside the CLI is in the works. For now, you have to restart the bot manually for your changes to take effect.
<PackageManagers command="dev" text="" />
